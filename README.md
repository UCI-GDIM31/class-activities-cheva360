1. Why are the r, g, and b variables floats instead of ints, bools, or strings?
- The RGB values need to be float (fractional numbers) not integers (whole numbers) because the rgb values range from 0.0 to 1.0 (integer values cannot represent any value in between 1 and 0)

2. Why is the _bounce variable an int instead of a float, bool, or string?
- _bounce is a variable that counts the number of bounces, which can only be whole numbers. Float is for fractional numbers and integers is for whole numbers therefore int is the variable type used.

3. The error you got after Step 4 of Part 2 told you something useful about why that line of code was broken- what was it?
- If I remember correctly after uncommenting the line either required a semicolon ; to signify the end of the statement, or an f at the end of the value to signify a color value.
